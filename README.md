## Move Generation 
 + It produces every possible move for every player based on the current setup of the board while carefully following the unique movement rules of each piece.
## Move Validation 
 + The algorithm carefully verifies each one to make sure it complies with chess rules, blocking moves that might threaten a player's king or break other rules of the game.
## Move Evaluation 
 + The algorithm evaluate every move's strategic value, taking into account several aspects like material gain, piece mobility, and king safety. This allows the game to make educated choices as it progresses.
